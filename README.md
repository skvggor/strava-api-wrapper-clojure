I developed a program that integrates with the Strava API to retrieve and display my total running distance for the current year. By connecting to my Strava account, it fetches the necessary data and outputs the total distance I've run, providing me with an easy way to track my annual progress. I created this project as a way to learn and explore the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) programming language.
